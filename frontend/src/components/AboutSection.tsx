        <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
          We started this journey back in 2022 with a simple dream: to create everyday clothing that feels good, looks great, 
          and speaks your vibe. What began as a small idea between friends soon grew into a brand made for people who live life
          with energy and confidence.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
          At Tropical, we blend comfort with attitude — from soft, breathable t-shirts to timeless jeans and accessories that complete your look.
          Every piece is designed with real people in mind, made for daily wear, adventures, and everything in between.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          We believe fashion isn’t about following trends — it’s about creating your own.
          And with Tropical, you don’t just wear clothes. You wear confidence, comfort, and a bit of sunshine wherever you go.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stay real. Stay bold. Stay Tropical.
