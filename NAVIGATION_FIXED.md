# âœ… Navigation to Customization Fixed

## Problem
The Navbar had links to `/customize` which resulted in a 404 error because the route didn't exist.

## Solution
Created a new page that lists all customizable products and added the route.

## What Was Added

### 1. New Page: CustomizableProducts
**File:** `frontend/src/pages/CustomizableProducts.tsx`

- Displays product image, name, price, and available sizes

### 2. Route Added
**File:** `frontend/src/App.tsx`

Added route:
```tsx
<Route path="/customize" element={<CustomizableProducts />} />
```

## Navigation Flow

### From Navbar
1. User clicks **"Customize"** in navbar
2. Goes to `/customize` â†’ Shows all customizable products
3. User clicks on a product
4. Goes to `/customize-product/:slug` â†’ Full customization page

### From Product Page
1. User browses to a specific product
2. If product is customizable, sees **"ðŸŽ¨ Customize This Product"** button

## Routes Summary

| Route | Page | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `/` | Index | Home page |

## Testing

### Test the Navigation
1. **Start frontend:** `cd frontend && npm run dev`
2. **Open:** `http://localhost:5173`
3. **Click "Customize" in navbar** â†’ Should show customizable products page
4. **Click on any customizable product** â†’ Should open customization page

### If No Products Show
This means no products in the database have `customizable: true`. To fix:

1. **Open CMS:** `http://localhost:8080`
2. **Go to Products**
3. **Edit a product**
4. **Check "Allow Customization"**
5. **Save**
6. **Refresh frontend** â†’ Product should now appear in `/customize`
