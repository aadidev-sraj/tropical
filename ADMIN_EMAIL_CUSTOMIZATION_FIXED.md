# ✅ Admin Email Customization Images - Fixed

## Problem
Admin was not receiving customization images with order confirmation emails.

## Solution
Updated the `sendAdminOrderNotification` function to include customization images, just like the customer email.

---

## What Was Fixed

### File: `backend/src/services/email.service.js`

#### 1. Added Image Collection Logic
- Loops through order items
- Checks for `item.customization.frontImageUrl` and `item.customization.backImageUrl`
- Builds HTML to display images
- Adds images as email attachments

#### 2. Added Customization Section to Email HTML
```html
<!-- Customization Images -->
${customizationImagesHtml}
```

#### 3. Added Attachments to Mail Options
```javascript
attachments: attachments.length > 0 ? attachments : undefined
```

**Required in `.env`:**
```env
# Email Configuration
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-app-password

# Admin Email (receives order notifications)

```

### Admin Email Priority

{
  filename: 'Product-Name-front-1.png',
  path: 'http://localhost:5000/uploads/customization-front-123.png',
  cid: 'admin-front-0@customization'
}
```
