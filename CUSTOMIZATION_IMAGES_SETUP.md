# âœ… Customization Images - Complete Implementation

## Overview
The system now captures customized t-shirt images, stores them in the database, and sends them to admin with order confirmation emails.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. âœ… Image Capture
- Uses `html2canvas` library to capture screenshots
- Captures both front and back views
- High-quality PNG images (scale: 2)

### 2. âœ… Image Upload
- Uploads captured images to server
- Stores in `/uploads` folder
- Returns image URLs

### 3. âœ… Database Storage
- Order model updated with customization field
- Stores image URLs for front and back
- Stores design positions and sizes

### 4. âœ… Email Attachments
- Customization images embedded in email
- Images also attached as files
- Admin receives visual preview of customization

---

## Installation Required

### Frontend Package
You need to install `html2canvas` for screenshot capture:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install html2canvas
```

Or with yarn:
```bash
cd frontend
yarn add html2canvas
```

---

## How It Works

### Customer Flow

1. **Customer customizes product**
   - Selects designs for front/back
   - Positions and resizes designs
   - Clicks "Add to Cart"

2. **System captures images**
   - Toast notification: "Capturing customization images..."
   - Switches to front view â†’ captures screenshot
   - Switches to back view â†’ captures screenshot
   - Each capture takes ~100ms

3. **Images uploaded to server**
   - Converts screenshots to PNG blobs
   - Uploads via `/api/upload/single` endpoint
   - Returns image URLs

4. **Saved to cart**
   - Cart item includes:
     - `frontImageUrl`: URL of front view screenshot
     - `backImageUrl`: URL of back view screenshot
     - All design details (position, size, etc.)

5. **Order placed**
   - Customization data saved to order in database
   - Images stored permanently

6. **Email sent**
   - Admin receives order confirmation
   - Email includes embedded customization images
   - Images also attached as PNG files

## Database Schema

### Order Model - Item Customization
```javascript
{
  items: [{
    productId: Number,
    name: String,
    price: Number,
    quantity: Number,
    size: String,
    image: String,
    customization: {
      frontDesign: String,           // Design ID
      backDesign: String,             // Design ID
      frontDesignPos: { x: Number, y: Number },
      backDesignPos: { x: Number, y: Number },
      frontDesignSize: Number,
      backDesignSize: Number,
      frontImageUrl: String,          // âœ¨ NEW: Screenshot URL
      backImageUrl: String            // âœ¨ NEW: Screenshot URL
    }
  }]
}
```

## Email Template Updates

### Customization Section
The order confirmation email now includes:

```html
<!-- Customization Images -->
<div style="margin: 20px 0; padding: 20px; background: #f9f9f9;">
  <h3>ðŸŽ¨ Customized: Product Name</h3>
  <div style="display: flex; gap: 15px;">
    <div>
      <p>Front View:</p>
      <img src="[front-image-url]" alt="Front customization" />
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Back View:</p>
      <img src="[back-image-url]" alt="Back customization" />
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```
